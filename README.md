## What does this bring me as a...
### **Player**
- **Symmetry Mode**
  - More symmetry modes that expand from the stock's Mirror, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 & 8. With this mod you'll also have **10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32 & 64**.
  - Automatically set the symmetry to the node symmetry group. So ie if you have a tricoupler, it will **automatically set your SymmetryMode** to the right one.
  - Any other symmetry mode that you desire, if you go to the window on the Appbar (inside the OAB, next to the engineer's report) you'll open a window where it will allow you to override the current **Symmetry mode from 0-512x**
- **VFX**
  - You can disable the **OAB sparks** on placement
- **AngleSnap**
  - You'll be able to choose a custom **angle snap** between the new options of **1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90ยบ**
- **Assembly Manipulation**
  - Send your vessel to the lowest point (without clipping the ground)
  - Precisely move your vessels on all 3 axis, or even center them!
- **Part Manipulation**
  - By default the mod extends the **part offset range by 10x**. Move your parts to wherever you want
### **Modder**
- **Custom Labels**
  - Add any label you desire, with custom colors, names and abbrevations. See more [here](https://github.com/LuxStice/LuxsOABExtensions/wiki/Sizes)
  - Set your parts to any of the existing labels! See more [here](https://github.com/LuxStice/LuxsOABExtensions/wiki/LOABEParts)
